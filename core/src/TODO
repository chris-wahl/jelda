TODO: World Transition Plan
  INSIDE WORLD
       ~~ Separate GameWorld subclasses ~~~
    1. Load Inside World TileTextures
        - Modify MapManager to handle different classes of maps
    2. Build Inside World level template
    3. Set exit doorway for Inside World level

  DOOR SENSORS
    1.  Design doorway sensors
        - Given a level & tilegrid position
        - Given overworld doorway ( single tile ) or inside room ( double tile )
        - Autoadjust position and width as a result
        OR
        - Make InsideDoorSensor an extended class

NOTES:: Separate Inside Sensors and Dungeon sensors in the O.G. Overworld map by giving them a specific tilenumber.

    2.  Detect doorways
    3.  Place Doorway Sensors:
        - Tell sensor which world to transition to
        - Which room in that world to transition to
        - Use Spawnpoint in that room

// TODO: Passing Link between worlds
Test link changing worlds

NOTES::  ~~Allow GameWorldManager to hold the only copy of Link.  When entering world, pass this reference and attach it to the body~~
        Test this.
