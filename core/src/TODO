Basic Overworld/World transition complete.

// TODO: Draw LevelChange Sensors
~~ 1.  Build LevelChangeSensor Class ~~
~~ 2.  Set camTargets to RoomCenters ~~
~~  - Add debug test L key to set link as camtarget ~~
~~ 3.  Test changes ~~
~~ 4.  Set level loaded checking to be performed when the LevelChangeSensor untriggers (and sets on current level),
   rather than constantly ~~
~~ 4a.  Send vertical/horizontal flag into constructor; store for repeated cases of MakeBody ~~

~~ 5a. Setup Level to set a LevelChangeSensor on desired tiles - will be loaded/unloaded with the rest of the tiles/sensors ~~
~~ 5b. Detect positions appropriate to place level senors in overWorld (sand tile, grey tile) ~~
~~  - Run along top edge of Level and Right edge of level ~~
~~  - Sensors require two instances of Level, thus must set AFTER levels are created - InitGrid() already called ~~

// TODO: Post work
~~~ - Determine camera error in InsideWorld load ~~~
~~~ - Check multi-door sensors ~~~
