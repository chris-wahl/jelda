TODO: World Transition Plan
  INSIDE WORLD
    1. Load Inside World TileTextures
        - Modify MapManager to handle different classes of maps
    2. Build Inside World level template
    3. Set exit doorway for Inside World level

  DOOR SENSORS
    1.  Design doorway sensors
        - Given a level & tilegrid position
        - Given overworld doorway ( single tile ) or inside room ( double tile )
        - Autoadjust position and width as a result
        OR
        - Make InsideDoorSensor an extended class

    2.  Detect doorways
    3.  Place Doorway Sensors:
        - Tell sensor which world to transition to
        - Which room in that world to transition to
        - Use Spawnpoint in that room


NOTES::  What gets loaded first?  Map/Textures or Levels?
            - If levels, set up doorsensor detector in MapManager/Texture
            - If MapManager, set up doorsensor detector in tile creation (Level reference needs to exist to pass to DoorSensorTarget)
