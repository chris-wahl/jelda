// TODO: Draw LevelChange Sensors
1.  Build LevelChangeSensor Class
2.  Set camTargets to RoomCenters
    - Add debug test L key to set link as camtarget
3.  Test changes
4.  Set level loaded checking to be performed when the LevelChangeSensor untriggers (and sets on current level),
    rather than constantly
